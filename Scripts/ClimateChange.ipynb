    "Now I'm going to look at filtering just to climate change policies. Looking through all of the policies, we really can't automate this fully as there's no consistent linguistic flag. It's also super subjective, we'll have to set SOME kind of parameters for what we consider \"climate change related\". For instance, \"Increasing Aboriginal land rights\" isn't directly climate change but could obviously have a big impact. Likewise any number of mining or mineral-export topics. Like... is supporting the mining industry anti-climate change? Also biodiversity... for instance, fishing restrictions are meant to keep fish stock stable/sustainable, but I assume that's also very related to climate change since more restrictions > higher prices > less fish consumption > better for climate change? but not if it's being replaced by, say beef consumption? Arghhh being in politics must be hard! For now I'm just gonna go with \"very obviously climate change policy related\" and I'll consider all these other things later!!"
